### About the program
This <b>Phone Book</b> has been designed by Louise, Aurélien and Matthieu for the 25th March 2016. This program allows you to create your phone book, to fill it with contacts, to register them wherever you want in CSV and to open a CSV file previously registered.

### Elements used
We used [JetBrains Pycharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) to develop the program. Also, we used [pyQt5](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/) with [Python 3.4](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.3/).
The icons have been designed by ourselves. All rights are reserved.
We thank you for using our program, and hope it suits you.
